# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Charles! 

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer.

My most **AND** least favorite thing about technology is there is so much to learn. I want to know everything there is to know about web development but I don't have enough time on this planet to learn it all. Despite this fact I've narrowed down some fantastic technologies to focus on! 

## My Current Stack 

### Frontend

1. React.js
2. Next.js
3. Material UI
4. TypeScript

### Backend 

1. Firebase
3. Express.js

I've also done some work with Django/Python but those are currently on the back burner!
